Project that simulate audio studio for recording audiobooks. 

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies 

##### Frontend

- Angular
- RxJS
- SASS
- Jest
- JWT
- TypeScript

##### Backend

- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- NodeJS
- Express
- Multer

#### Infra

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- MySQL
- Nginx 

### ü™öRunnin Backend manually

Create an `.env` and set the two follow environment variables bellow:

`SERVER_PORT=3333` - The PORT where the server will be running
`TOKEN_KEY=secret_jwt` - The JWT secret key to your aplication

Set the database password defined at `docker-compose.yaml`

After, navigate to `back` folder and install project dependecies typing on your terminal the follow:

```console
npm install

// If you have yarn installed type
yarn
```

To start development server type

```console
npm run dev

// If you have yarn installed type
yarn dev
```

The server will be running at the port defined by the environment variable `SERVER_PORT`

### ü™öRunning Front-end manually

Navigate to `front` folder and install project dependecies typing on your terminal the follow:

```console
npm install

// If you have yarn installed type
yarn
```

To start development server run
```console
npm start

// If you have yarn installed
yarn start
```

#### üß™ Running unit tests

```console
npm run test

// If you have yarn installed
yarn test
```
#### üé¢Raise up production infra trought docker-compose

1 - First, with docker up running and docker-compose installed on your machine run the following on terminal:
```console
docker-compose up
```

> The previous step it gonna raise up the front-end, back-end and database 


2 - In order to see the containers up running run on our terminal:
```console
docker ps
```
